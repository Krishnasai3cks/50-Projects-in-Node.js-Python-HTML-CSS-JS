                <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
                    Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p> Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
                <p>
                    Python was created in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.

            <p>Introduced in 1996 for the Solaris, Windows, Mac OS Classic and Linux, Java was initially released as the Java Development Kit 1.0 (JDK 1.0). This included the Java runtime (the virtual machine and the class libraries), and the development
                tools (e.g., the Java compiler). Later, Sun also provided a runtime-only package, called the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The first name stuck, however, so usually people refer to a particular version of Java by its JDK version (e.g.,
                JDK 1.0).</p>
            <p>The team started thinking of replacing C++ with a better version, a faster version, a responsive version. But the one thing they hadn't thought of, as of yet, was that the language they were aiming for had to be developed for an embedded system
                with limited resources. An embedded system is a computer system scaled to a minimalistic interface demanding only a few functions from its design. For such a system, C++ or any successor would seem too large as all the languages at the
                time demanded a larger footprint than what was desired. The team thus had to think in a different way to go about solving all these problems.
                <br> Co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Bill Joy, envisioned a language combining the power of Mesa and C in a paper named Further he wrote for the engineers at Sun. Gathering ideas, Gosling began work on enhancing C++ and named it "C++ ++
                --", a pun on the evolutionary structure of the language's name. The ++ and -- meant, putting in and taking out stuff. He soon abandoned the name and called it Oak[1] after the tree that stood outside his office.</p>

                        <br> &emsp;&emsp; 
                        System.out.println("Hello World!");
                        <br>
                   &emsp; }<br>

            <p>The field of computing as we know it today started in 1947 with three scientists at Bell Telephone Laboratories—William Shockley, Walter Brattain, and John Bardeen—and their groundbreaking invention: the transistor. In 1956, the first fully
                transistor-based computer, the TX-0, was completed at MIT. The first integrated circuit was created in 1958 by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments, but the first high-level programming language existed even before then.</p>
            <p>C was the direct successor of B, a stripped down version of BCPL, created by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs, that was also a compiled language - User's Reference to B, used in early internal versions of the UNIX operating system. As noted in Ritchie's
                C History : "The B compiler on the PDP-7 did not generate machine instructions, but instead 'threaded code', an interpretive scheme in which the compiler's output consists of a sequence of addresses of code fragments that perform the elementary
                operations. The operations typically — in particular for B — act on a simple stack machine". Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, also working at Bell Labs, improved B and called the result NB. Further extensions to NB created its logical successor,
                C. Most of UNIX was rewritten in NB, and then C, which resulted in a more portable operating system.</p>

            <p>During the 1990s C++ grew to become one of the most popular computer programming languages, and it is still the third most popular language, according to the Tiobe rankings as of November 2017. C++ was first designed with a focus on systems
                programming, but its features also make it an attractive language for creating end-user applications, especially those with resource constraints, or that require very high performance. C++ is extensively used in game development, web clients/server
                side, back office of financial applications and robotics.</p>
            <p>C++ is not the ideal first language. However, if you are willing to dedicate a more than passing interest in C++, then you can even learn it as your first language. Make sure to dedicate some time understanding the different paradigms and
                why C++ is a multi-paradigm, or hybrid, language.
                <br> If you are approaching the learning process only to add another notch under your belt, that is, willing only to dedicate enough effort to understand its major quirks and learn something about its dark corners, then you would be best
                served in learning two other languages first. This will clarify what makes C++ special in its approach to programming. You should select one imperative and one object-oriented language. C will probably be the best choice for the former,
                as it has a good market value and a direct relation to C++, although a good substitute would be ASM. For the latter, Java is a good choice, mostly because it shares much of its syntax with C++ but it does not support imperative programming.
                Read the language comparison section for better understanding the relations.</p>

                class Main{<br>
                    &emsp;void main(){<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;printf("happy birthday");<br>
                    &emsp;}<br>

            <p>The best scenario is if you have access to a commercial (perhaps free) web hosting service. Most likely it supports PHP and MySQL "out of the box"; it's pretty standard these days. The downside is, unless you have shell access and are comfortable
                with text-mode text editors, you will have to FTP your PHP scripts to the server every time you make any changes (that will be very often), this gets very annoying after a while. If your desktop is running on Windows, I suggest you download
                the text editor editplus, which can open a file over FTP and whenever you save, upload automatically to the FTP site. A good open source alternative is jEdit, which can open and save automatically over FTP and even SFTP (secure) if one
                installs the FTP plugin. jEdit is written in Java, so it runs on Mac OS X, OS/2, Unix, VMS and Windows. For you Linux people, you can also use something like CurlFtpFS (http://curlftpfs.sourceforge.net/), which lets you mount an FTP location
                as if it were any other mountable object, and thus all those nasty file transfers are done transparently, and you can use any editor you want. If you're blessed with a shell account, but are equally lazy, SSHFS (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html)
                is the one for you (assuming you use SSH to access your account...)</p>
            <p>Please remember that anytime you upload an executable script to your web site, you create an opportunity for a malicious user to exploit any vulnerabilities in your code. In fact, one of the major advantages of operating on a commercial web
                host's server is that your scripts are prevented from affecting many critical parts of the machine. As long as you do not store important information on your web site, any damage a malicious user could cause will be kept to a minimum.
                <br> Some web hosting companies offer different features but most have a purchased product that allows you to navigate your server space quite easily. It is called cPanel and it is a great way to learn how to either start web designing
                or become an advanced web designer/programmer. Plesk is similar in nature.</p>
            <code>
                echo "Hello World!";<br>
                echo "PHP is so easy!";

            <p>JavaScript has no relation to Java aside from having a C-like syntax. Netscape developed JavaScript, and Sun Microsystems developed Java. The rest of this section assumes a background in programming. You may skip to the next section, if you
                like.
                <br> Variables have a static type (integer or string for example) that remains the same during the lifespan of a running program in Java, and have a dynamic type (Number or String for example) that can change during the lifespan of a running
                program in JavaScript. Variables must be declared prior to use in Java, and have a undefined value when referred to prior to assignment in JavaScript.</p>
            <p>JavaScript engines must extend the JavaScript language beyond the ECMAScript language standard, if additional functionality is desired, such as the required functionality provided by V8, or the Document Object Model found in many Web browsers.
                <br> Java includes classes and object instances, and JavaScript uses prototypes.</p>
